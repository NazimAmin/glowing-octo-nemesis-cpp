Create a class ComplexNumber. It will contain two private data members real and imag
defined as doubles. Your class should include a constructor that allows the data members
to be specified as parameters of the constructor. A default (non-parameterized)
constructor should initialize the data members to 0.0.

Your class should include the following public member functions (write their prototypes
and their definitions): getRealPart( ) which returns the real part of the complex number;
getImagPart( ) which returns the imaginary part of the complex number; setReal and
setImage which will store values into a the private data members real or imag; as well as
member functions addComplex, subtractComplex and multiplyComplex.

Include the function print (it prints the real and imaginary parts of the ComplexNumber
object) as a member function of the class.
Write a driver program to test all of the above functions.
Submit printout of your source code and your output.
NOTE:
