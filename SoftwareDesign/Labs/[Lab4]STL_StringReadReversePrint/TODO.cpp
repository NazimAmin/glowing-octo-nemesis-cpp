CSC 330 Lab – Using STL
Make the program bellow to work and to produce the kind of output you see at the bottom.
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <iterator>
#include <algorithm>
#include <functional>
using namespace std;
// This function reverses a string in place. For example,
// if the original value of the string was "cat", the
// value after reversing it is "tac".
void reverse(string& s){
int i = 0, j = s.length() - 1;
while(i < j){
swap(s[i++], s[j--]);
}
}
void main(){
// Create a vector of strings and allocate 100 elements worth of space
// to start with.
vector<string> theWords;
theWords.reserve(100);
// Create an iterator that will iterate over the strings in the input
// stream cin. Also create an iterator that matches the end of the input.
istream_iterator<string> stringReader(cin);
istream_iterator<string> stringReaderEOF;
// Read strings in one at a time and push them onto the vector.
while(stringReader != stringReaderEOF){
theWords.push_back(*stringReader++);
}
// Show the words.
cout << "The words read in are:\n";
// 1: Fill in the function argument so that
// the output from this statement will be the words,
// one to a line. Do the same with each copy()
// call in the code below. See the sample output.
copy( );
//Make of copy of the input.
vector<string> aCopy(theWords);
// Now reverse all the strings in the copy and show the result.
// 2: Complete the for_each call so that
// it will reverse every string in the copy.
for_each( );
cout << "\nAfter reversing all the strings in the copy:\n";
copy( );
// 3. Sort the original strings in descending order.
// Complete the sort call so that this call will
// sort the words in theWords in descending order.
sort( );
cout << "\nAfter sorting the strings in descending order:\n";
copy( );
}
Sample output:
the rain in spain falls
mainly in the plain
^Z
^Z
The words read in are:
the
rain
in
spain
falls
mainly
in
the
plain
After reversing all the strings in the copy:
eht
niar
ni
niaps
sllaf
ylniam
ni
eht
nialp
After sorting the strings in descending order:
the
the
spain
rain
plain
mainly
in
